#### Practical Exercise: Energy Drink Expressions

To deepen your understanding of expressions, literals, and identifiers within a fun context, let's explore some exercises themed around energy drinks.

1. **Create a Numeric Literal Expression**:
   - **Task**: Imagine there's a limited edition energy drink that's only sold 7 days a week. Write an expression that represents the number of days this special drink is available.

2. **Combine String Literals**:
   - **Task**: You're creating an ad for a new energy drink called "Volt Surge". Write an expression that combines two string literals to form the tagline of the ad. For instance, if your taglines are `"Unleash"` and `"Your Potential!"`, your expression should put them together.
   - **Example Solution**:

3. **Use Identifiers**:
   - **Task**: Suppose you're tracking two types of energy drinks, `"Electrolyte+"` for hydration and `"Caffeine Blast"` for energy. Create two variables to represent these drinks. Then, write an expression that simulates creating a mix of both drinks for a new combination product.

4. **Experiment with Grouping Operators**:
   - **Task**: Imagine you're calculating the total cost of buying energy drinks for a week. Each drink costs $2, and you plan to buy 5 drinks a day. Write an expression to calculate the total cost, making sure to calculate the daily cost first before multiplying by the number of days.
