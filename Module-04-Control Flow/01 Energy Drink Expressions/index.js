// Exercise 1: Create a Numeric Literal Expression
// Instructions: Imagine there's a limited edition energy drink that's only sold 7 days a week.
// Write an expression that represents the number of days this special drink is available.
// Hint: Use a numeric literal to represent the number of days available.

// Exercise 2: Combine String Literals
// Instructions: You're creating an ad for a new energy drink called "Volt Surge".
// Write an expression that combines two string literals to form the tagline of the ad.
// Hint: Use string literals and the concatenation operator (+) to combine the strings.
// Example: "Unleash" + " Your Potential!" should result in "Unleash Your Potential!".

// Exercise 3: Use Identifiers
// Instructions: Suppose you're tracking two types of energy drinks, "Electrolyte+" for hydration
// and "Caffeine Blast" for energy. Create two variables to represent these drinks.
// Then, write an expression that simulates creating a mix of both drinks for a new combination product.
// Hint: Declare variables for the two drinks and use the concatenation operator (+) to combine them.
// Example: "Electrolyte+" + " & " + "Caffeine Blast" should result in "Electrolyte+ & Caffeine Blast".

// Exercise 4: Experiment with Grouping Operators
// Instructions: Imagine you're calculating the total cost of buying energy drinks for a week.
// Each drink costs $2, and you plan to buy 5 drinks a day.
// Write an expression to calculate the total cost, making sure to calculate the daily cost first
// before multiplying by the number of days.
// Hint: Use grouping operators (parentheses) to ensure the daily cost is calculated first.
// Example: (2 * 5) * 7 should result in $70.
