## Practice Challenge: Energy Drink Inventory 

Create a script to manage an inventory of energy drinks. Implement a loop to iterate through an array of energy drink objects, updating the inventory based on specific conditions.

#### Comments and Hints
- Use a `for` loop to initially increase the stock of each drink.
- Utilize a `while` loop for the condition where the stock needs to be adjusted down, ensuring it doesn't go below a certain threshold.
- Consider using `console.log` inside your loop to monitor changes to each drink's quantity for debugging purposes.

This exercise will help you understand how to manipulate data within arrays using loops, a common task in many JavaScript programs.
