Create a script that decides what type of energy drink to recommend based on the time of day and the user's energy level. Use three different conditions to demonstrate `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

By completing this exercise, you'll have practiced using conditional statements to control the flow of your program based on different scenarios. This skill is foundational for creating dynamic and responsive JavaScript applications.
