**Practical Exercise: Energy Drink Study Rewards**

In this practical exercise, we will create an energy drink-themed challenge where you can earn more caffeine as a reward for your study efforts. This challenge will help you apply flow control concepts, conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`), and explore the concept of truthy and falsy values.

**Energy Drink Study Rewards Challenge Brief**:

We rely on energy drinks to stay awake and focus while studying. The challenge is to create a program that determines the number of energy drinks you can have as a reward based on your study progress.

Here are the conditions:

1. You start with 2 energy drinks as a base.

2. If you've completed at least 3 coding exercises, you earn an additional 1 energy drink.

3. If you've spent more than 4 hours studying, you earn an additional 1 energy drink.

4. If you have a caffeine tolerance, which is represented by a boolean value (`true` or `false`), you earn an extra 2 energy drinks if your tolerance is `true`.

5. Your program should display the total number of energy drinks you can have as a reward.

**Hints**:

- You can use conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to check each condition.
- The concept of truthy and falsy values can be used to check whether a variable has a value or is `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string. For example, `if (codingExercises)` checks if `codingExercises` has a truthy value.

**Challenge Outcome**:

By completing this challenge, you will gain a deeper understanding of flow control, conditional statements, and how to work with truthy and falsy values in JavaScript. Plus, you'll know exactly how many energy drinks you can enjoy as a reward for your hard work and dedication to coding! Try not to make your heart explode.
