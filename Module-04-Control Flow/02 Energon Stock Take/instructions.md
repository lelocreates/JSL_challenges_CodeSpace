# Practice Challenge: Energon Stock Take

**Practical Exercise**: Apply your knowledge of operators in a challenge to calculate the total inventory value of energy drinks, considering various scenarios such as discounts, bulk purchase incentives, and stock levels. Use logical operators to make decisions based on inventory status and relational operators to compare sales data.

- Calculate the total value of a specific energy drink stock: Given the cost per unit and the stock level, calculate the total value.

- Apply a 10% discount if purchasing more than 20 units: Use a conditional statement and assignment operators to adjust the price accordingly.

**Challenge Instructions**:

Imagine you're managing an inventory of a popular energy drink called "Energon". You need to calculate the total value of the "Energon" stock based on certain conditions. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Calculate Total Value**:
   - You have the cost per unit of "Energon" which is $2.50.
   - You also have the stock level of "Energon" which is 30 units.
   - Calculate the total value of the "Energon" stock by multiplying the cost per unit with the stock level.

2. **Apply Discount**:
   - If the stock level of "Energon" is more than 20 units, apply a 10% discount on the cost per unit.
   - Recalculate the total value of the "Energon" stock after applying the discount.

3. **Output Results**:
   - Print the original total value of the "Energon" stock without the discount.
   - Print the total value of the "Energon" stock after applying the discount, if applicable.

Use JavaScript operators, conditional statements, and assignment operators to accomplish these tasks. Your code should be able to handle different scenarios, so feel free to change the stock level and observe the results.

Try changing the `stockLevel` value and observe how the code calculates the total value with or without the discount. This challenge will help you practice using operators and conditional statements in JavaScript.
