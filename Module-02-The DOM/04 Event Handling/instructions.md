#### Practical Exercise: Daily Water Intake Tracker
For this exercise, you'll enhance your fitness tracking project by adding a feature for users to log their daily water intake. Users should be able to increment or decrement their water intake count using buttons.

1. **HTML Setup**:
   - Include a display area to show the current water intake level.
   - Add two buttons: one to increment the water intake and another to decrement it.

2. **JavaScript Implementation**:
   - Write functions to handle incrementing and decrementing the water intake.
   - Attach event listeners to the buttons to respond to clicks, updating the water intake display accordingly.

```html
<div id="water-intake-tracker">
    <button id="decrement">-</button>
    <span id="water-intake">0</span> glasses
    <button id="increment">+</button>
</div>
```

```javascript
const incrementButton = document.querySelector('#increment');
const decrementButton = document.querySelector('#decrement');
const waterIntakeDisplay = document.querySelector('#water-intake');

let waterIntake = 0;

incrementButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    waterIntake++;
    waterIntakeDisplay.textContent = waterIntake;
});

decrementButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (waterIntake > 0) {
        waterIntake--;
    }
    waterIntakeDisplay.textContent = waterIntake;
});
```

Event handling is a powerful tool in your web development arsenal, enabling you to create highly interactive and responsive applications. By incorporating event listeners into your fitness tracking project, you're not only making it more engaging but also providing users with practical tools to monitor their health and fitness progress. Through practice and exploration, you'll discover countless ways to apply these techniques to enhance user experience across your web projects.
