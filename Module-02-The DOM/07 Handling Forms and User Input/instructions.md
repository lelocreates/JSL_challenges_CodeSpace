#### Practical Exercise: Weekly Meal Planner Form

Build a form that allows users to input their meal plans for the week, including options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for each day.

1. **Form Setup**:
   - Create a form with fields for each meal and day of the week. Include input fields for meal names and checkboxes for dietary preferences.
   ```html
   <form id="meal-plan-form">
     <div>
       <label for="monday-breakfast">Monday Breakfast:</label>
       <input type="text" id="monday-breakfast" name="monday-breakfast">
     </div>
     <!-- Repeat for each meal and day -->
     <button type="submit">Submit Meal Plan</button>
   </form>
   ```

2. **Validation Logic**:
   - Add JavaScript to validate that each meal has been planned before allowing the form to submit. Optionally, validate dietary checkboxes for at least one selection per day.
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('meal-plan-form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
     event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission
     // Validation logic here
     // If validation passes, process the form data
   });
   ```

Handling forms and validating user input effectively are critical skills for any web developer. They not only enhance the user experience by ensuring that users can submit forms successfully on their first attempt but also contribute to the overall data quality and security of your application. Through this exercise, you'll gain practical experience in implementing these concepts within the context of a fitness-focused web application, further solidifying your understanding of DOM manipulation techniques.
