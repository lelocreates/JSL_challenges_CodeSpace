// For this project, we'll outline a JavaScript file that builds up from lessons 1 to 8, focusing on creating a fitness tracker. Each section will be commented to show where new code was added for each lesson.

// Create a function called 'welcomeMessage' that performs the following steps:
// 1. Get the current date as a string and store it in the 'today' variable.
// 2. Get an element with the id 'welcomeMessage' and set its text content to a welcome message that includes the current date.

// Call the 'welcomeMessage' function to display the welcome message with the current date to the user.
