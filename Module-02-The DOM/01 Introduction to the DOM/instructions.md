#### Practical Exercise: Welcoming Users to Your Fitness Tracker
Let's start our fitness tracking project with a simple yet interactive feature - displaying a welcome message with the current date to the user.

**Step 1**: Open your HTML file and ensure you have a `<div>` element with an id. If not, add it like so:
```html
<div id="welcome-message"></div>
```

**Step 2**: In your JavaScript file, write your code:
```javascript
// Select the div element using its id
const welcomeDiv = document.getElementById('welcome-message');

// Create a new Date object
const today = new Date();

// Construct the welcome message
const welcomeMessage = `Welcome to your fitness tracker! Today is ${today.toDateString()}.`;

// Set the text content of the div to our welcome message
welcomeDiv.textContent = welcomeMessage;
```

This script selects an element by its ID, creates a message including today's date using the `Date` object, and then updates the text content of the selected element to display the message.

You've just taken your first step into DOM manipulation by dynamically updating a web page! This simple exercise illustrates the power of JavaScript combined with the DOM to create interactive and personalized user experiences. As you proceed, you'll learn to implement more complex features, enhancing your fitness tracking web application's functionality and user engagement.
