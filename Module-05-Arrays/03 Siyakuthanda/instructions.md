# Practice Challenge: African Actors Siyakuthanda

Practice using the `map` and `filter` methods to manage a list of actors and their characteristics.

**Scenario**:

Imagine you are tasked with managing a list of actors, including their names, year of birth, and whether they are from Africa. You need to perform two tasks: extracting the actors' names and filtering out actors from Africa.

**Task 1**: Create a new array `actorNames` that contains only the names of the actors using the `map` method.

**Task 2**: Use the `filter` method to create a new array `africanActors` that contains only the actors from Africa.

**Initial Actor List (Sample)**:
- Add more actors here (at least 10 in total)

**Instructions**:

1. Complete both tasks mentioned above using the `map` and `filter` methods.
2. Ensure that the `actorNames` array contains only the names of the actors, and the `africanActors` array contains only actors from Africa.
3. Test your code with the provided actor list or create your own list with at least 10 actors.
4. Share your solution and the resulting arrays (`actorNames` and `africanActors`) to demonstrate your understanding of these array manipulation techniques.

This challenge aims to improve your proficiency in using `map` and `filter` methods for extracting specific information from an array of objects, helping you build essential skills for working with data in JavaScript.
