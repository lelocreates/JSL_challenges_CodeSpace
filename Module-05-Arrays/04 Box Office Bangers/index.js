// Task 1: Log the title and release year of each movie using a for loop.

// Task 2: Create a new array movieTitles containing only the titles of the movies using the map method.
// Hint: Use the map method to extract the 'title' property from each object in the array.

// Task 3: Use the filter method to create a list of movies released after 2010.
// Hint: Use the filter method with a callback function to filter movies based on the 'year' property.

// Task 4: Find the movie with the highest box office revenue using the reduce method.
