### Practical Example: Marvel Movie Data Manipulation

**Objective**: Use different loops and iteration methods to cycle through an array of Marvel movie objects, performing various tasks.

Imagine you have an array of objects, where each object represents a Marvel movie with its title, release year, and box office revenue:

```javascript
const marvelMovieData = [
    { title: "Iron Man", year: 2008, revenue: 585.2 },
    { title: "Thor", year: 2011, revenue: 449.3 },
    { title: "The Avengers", year: 2012, revenue: 1518.8 },
    { title: "Guardians of the Galaxy", year: 2014, revenue: 773.3 },
    { title: "Black Panther", year: 2018, revenue: 1346.9 }
];
```

**Task 1**: Log the title and release year of each movie using a `for` loop.

**Task 2**: Create a new array `movieTitles` containing only the titles of the movies using the `map` method.

**Task 3**: Use the `filter` method to create a list of movies released after 2010.

**Task 4**: Find the movie with the highest box office revenue using the `reduce` method.

Through these exercises, you'll get hands-on experience with loops and array iteration methods, essential tools for navigating and manipulating arrays in JavaScript. By mastering these techniques, you'll be able to handle complex data structures more effectively and write cleaner, more efficient code.
