#### Instructions

1. **Localize the Series Titles**: Start by converting the titles of the Netflix series array into your home language. If there isn't an official translation, creatively translate the title to capture the essence of the series. Use Unicode escape sequences (\uXXXX) to represent special characters or emojis that are unique to your language.

2. **Update the Function**: Revise the `printFavoriteSeries` function to output the series names in your native language. Ensure that any special characters or diacritical marks specific to your language are correctly represented using Unicode escape sequences (\uXXXX).

3. **Function Testing**: Pick an index number to test your function. Ensure it accurately displays the series name in your chosen language.

4. HTML Code: Recreate the input field, button, and display area. Replace the text within the HTML tags with the appropriate translation in your native language. This will make the user interface of your application accessible in your language.
