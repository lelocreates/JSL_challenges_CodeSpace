### Practice Challenge: Pet Profile Manager
// Note that this challenge runs in the CONSOLE. 

#### Objective
Create a JavaScript program to manage pet profiles, demonstrating the understanding of immutable primitive values and mutable object references in JavaScript. The challenge is themed around a pet management system, where you can update pet profiles and display their details. This challenge will be done in the console.

#### Instructions
1. **Create Pet Profiles**:
   - Define two pet profiles as objects. Each profile should include the pet's name, age, and type (e.g., dog, cat).
   - Example: `let pet1 = { name: 'Buddy', age: 5, type: 'Dog' };`
   - Add your own objects here if you want.

2. **Immutable Primitive Value Manipulation**:
   - Attempt to change the pet's name using string manipulation.
   - Display how the original name remains unchanged, demonstrating immutability.

3. **Mutable Object Reference Manipulation**:
   - Update the age of one of the pets by directly modifying the property.
   - Create a new reference to one of the pet objects and modify its type.
   - Show how changes to one reference affect the original object, demonstrating mutability.

4. **Display Results**:
   - Log the final profiles of both pets to the console.

5. **Commenting**:
   - Add comments to your code explaining how immutability and mutability are demonstrated in each step.

#### Expected Outcome
Understand that primitive values (like strings in `pet1.name`) are immutable and that when they are manipulated, a new value is created rather than altering the original value. On the other hand, objects are mutable, and when a property of an object is changed, or when an object is manipulated through another reference, the original object is affected. This understanding is crucial for effective JavaScript programming, especially when dealing with data structures and functions.

#### Solution Code
The solution code will be the same as the starter code. The key learning outcome is understanding the difference between immutable and mutable types in JavaScript, as demonstrated in the code. So play around and happy coding!
