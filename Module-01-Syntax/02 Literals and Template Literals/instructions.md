### Coding Challenge: Pet Profile Generator

#### Overview

Create a fun JavaScript program that generates pet profiles using literals and template literals. This will help you understand how to use different types of literals in JavaScript effectively.

#### Instructions

1. **Create a Pet Profile Using Standard String Literals**:
   - Use the given variables to create a string describing the pet.
   - Use concatenation with standard string literals.

2. **Create a Pet Profile Using Template Literals**:
   - Rewrite the pet profile using template literals.
   - Include multi-line text and embedded expressions.

3. **Console Output**:
   - Print both versions of the pet profile to the console.

4. **Bonus Challenge**:
   - Add more variables (like `petHobbies`, `petFavoriteFood`) and include them in the pet profile.
   
#### Expected Output

When you run this code you should see three different pet profiles printed to the console: one using standard string literals, one using template literals, and the bonus one with additional details.

This challenge helps you grasp the practical use of literals in JavaScript, contrasting the simplicity and enhanced readability offered by template literals against standard string concatenation methods.
