#### Practice Challenge:  Enhancing the Bank Account Object

Let's add functionality to our bank account object. We'll include methods for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as a method to display the current balance.

1. **Deposit Method**: Adds money to the balance.
2. **Withdraw Method**: Subtracts money from the balance if enough funds are available.
3. **Display Balance Method**: Shows the current balance.

Through this exercise, you've seen how to make objects more dynamic and interactive by using methods. Methods enrich your objects, allowing them to not just hold data, but also perform tasks and actions. This is a stepping stone into more complex and powerful object-oriented programming concepts you'll learn next.
