By exploring and extending JavaScript's built-in objects, you gain a deeper understanding of how to utilize these powerful tools in your programming toolkit, making your code more efficient and your applications more robust. Just as a well-organized bank operates smoothly, understanding and leveraging built-in objects appropriately can lead to cleaner, more effective code.
