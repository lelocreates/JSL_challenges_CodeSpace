#### Practice Challenge: Creating a Bank Account Object

Let's create an object representing a bank account. This object will have properties for the account holder's name, account number, and balance. We'll also display its properties in the console.

This simple exercise demonstrates how to create an object, access its properties, and modify them. As you continue learning JavaScript, you'll discover the power of objects for organizing and managing data in your applications.
