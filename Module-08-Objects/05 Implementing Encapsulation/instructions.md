#### Practice Challenge: Implementing Encapsulation

Create a `Customer` class that represents a bank customer. The class should encapsulate the customer's name, account number (as a private field), and account balance. Provide methods to deposit or withdraw money and another method to display the account balance, ensuring the account number remains private and is only accessible through a getter method.

This exercise will reinforce the concept of encapsulation and information hiding, demonstrating how to protect sensitive information while allowing controlled access to an object's data.
