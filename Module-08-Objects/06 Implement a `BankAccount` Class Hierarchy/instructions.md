#### Practice Challenge: Implement a `BankAccount` Class Hierarchy

For your practical exercise, extend the `BankAccount` class to create `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` classes. Each class should override or add methods relevant to its type. For instance, `SavingsAccount` might include a method to apply interest, while `CheckingAccount` could allow an overdraft up to a certain limit.

By implementing this class hierarchy, you'll gain hands-on experience with inheritance, understanding how derived classes can inherit from a base class while also defining their own unique behaviors. This is a powerful demonstration of both polymorphism and inheritance in action, illustrating how different objects (accounts, in our case) can share common traits yet behave differently when interacting with the same operations (like withdrawing or depositing money).
