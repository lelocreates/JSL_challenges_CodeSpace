#### Practical Exercise: Interest Rate Global Property

Let's put this into practice with a banking-themed exercise:

1. **Add a Global Property**: Write a script that adds a property called `baseInterestRate` to the global object and sets it to `0.025` (2.5%).
2. **Access It**: Then, access this property in a function that calculates interest on savings and console log it from both the global scope and inside a function.

This exercise not only reinforces how to work with the global object but also illustrates its practical use across different parts of your JavaScript code. Remember, while the global object is powerful, it's best used sparingly to keep your code organized and maintainable.
