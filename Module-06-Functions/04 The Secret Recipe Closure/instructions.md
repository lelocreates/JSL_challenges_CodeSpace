### Practice Challenge: The Secret Recipe Closure

**Objective**: Create a web application that simulates the process of KFC chefs preparing fried chicken meals with a secret ingredient. This challenge will help you understand closures by practicing how to create and use them within functions.

#### Challenge Instructions:

1. **Create an HTML file** (`index.html`) for the application. Include a form where users can select a type of meal (e.g., "Dinner", "Lunch") and enter their choice of side dish. Use the provided `link` and `script` tags to include your CSS and JavaScript files.

2. **Design a CSS file** (`index.css`) to style your application. Make it appealing by styling the form and the display area where the meal preparation messages will be shown.

3. **Implement JavaScript logic** (`index.js`) to handle the meal preparation process using closures. Your script should capture the meal type and side dish from the form, then display a custom message about how the meal is being prepared with the secret ingredient.

This challenge illustrates how closures work by simulating a meal preparation process that depends on the chosen meal type and side dish, incorporating KFC's secret ingredient. The closure captures and uses these details to display a custom preparation message.

#### Solution:

Swap your index.js script tag in your HTML file to the solution.js script.
<!-- <script src="solution.js" defer></script> -->
