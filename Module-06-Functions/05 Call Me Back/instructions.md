### Practice Challenge: "Call Me Back"

**Objective**: Debug and complete a function to handle pizza orders efficiently using callback functions, emphasizing the understanding and implementation of callbacks in JavaScript.

#### Challenge Instructions:

1. **Scenario**: You are developing a web application for "Pizza Planet," a popular pizza delivery service. The application takes pizza orders from customers, processes them, and provides a callback with the status of the order.

2. **Your Task**: Debug and complete the provided JavaScript function to ensure it properly uses callback functions to notify the customer of their order status. Follow the guided instructions and hints in the starter code to fill out the function skeleton.

3. **Requirements**:
    - Complete the function `processOrder` that accepts an order object and a callback function as arguments.
    - The order object will contain properties for the pizza name and customer details.
    - Implement error handling within `processOrder`. If the pizza name is "Unknown Pizza," invoke the callback with an error message. Otherwise, invoke the callback with a null error and a success message.
    - Display the callback message (success or error) in the UI.

4. **UI Elements**:
    - An input field for the customer to enter the pizza name.
    - A button to submit the order.
    - A div to display the order status message.
