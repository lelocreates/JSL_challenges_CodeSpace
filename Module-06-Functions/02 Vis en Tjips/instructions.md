# Practice Challenge: Hoisting Test - Vis en Tjips Edition

In this coding challenge, you'll explore the concept of variable hoisting in JavaScript with a fun twist - Fish and Chips! You will declare a variable at the bottom of a function and attempt to access it at the top of the same function. Your task is to observe the output and explain why it happens.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a JavaScript function named `orderFishAndChips`.

2. Inside the `orderFishAndChips` function, follow these steps:

   a. Declare a variable named `fish` and assign it the string value `"Hake"` at the bottom of the function.

   b. Try to `console.log` the value of `fish` at the top of the function (before the declaration). For example:

3. Explain why the output is as expected or why it differs from your expectations. Provide a brief explanation of the hoisting concept in JavaScript.
