### Practice Challenge: Fries Feast 

#### Challenge Overview

Welcome to the Fries Feast coding challenge! In this challenge, you'll create an interactive web page that helps a user organize a fries feast by choosing different fries types and toppings. This challenge will test your understanding of global vs. local scope in JavaScript, as well as your ability to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

#### Challenge Instructions

1. **Create the HTML Structure**: Start by creating an HTML file with the following elements:
   - A dropdown menu (`<select>`) for choosing the type of fries.
   - A text input field for adding a special topping.
   - A submit button to confirm the choice.
   - A `<div>` element where the final order will be displayed.

2. **Add Basic Styling**: Use CSS to style your page. Make it appealing by adding styles to the dropdown menu, input field, button, and display area.

3. **JavaScript Task**: You will write JavaScript code that captures the user's selections and displays a summary of their order. Pay special attention to the use of global and local variables to achieve this.


#### Challenge Goals

- Capture the user's fries type and topping selections.
- Use a global variable to store a part of the order message and local variables within the `displayOrder` function to construct the full order summary.
- Display the final order summary in the `#orderSummary` div when the user clicks the submit button.

This coding challenge will help solidify your understanding of scope in JavaScript by applying it to a fun and interactive project. Good luck, and enjoy your Fries Feast!

#### Solution:
